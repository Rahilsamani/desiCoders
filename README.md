You can install **deepfake_image_detection** via pip:

```bash
pip install deepfake_image_detection
```

# Usage

from deepfake_image_detection import classify_image_from_url

**Classify an image from URL**

result = classify_image_from_url("https://example.com/image.jpg")
print("Result:", result)

from deepfake_image_detection import classify_image_from_url
